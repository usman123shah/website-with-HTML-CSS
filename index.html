        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>I'm <strong>Syed Usman Ahmed Shah, a Computer Science student</strong> in my third year with a strong passion for technology, programming, and problem-solving. I have experience in Python, C++, Java, and web development, and I've worked on projects like an inventory management system and system programming tools in Linux. Alongside my studies, I have hands-on experience in digital marketing, data extraction, and social media outreach.

            <br>I enjoy building practical solutions and continuously expanding my skills, whether through programming, web design, or business-oriented projects. Currently, I'm working on an AI-based code debugger and reviewer, aiming to enhance coding efficiency. Outside of tech, I have a keen interest in anime, collecting One Piece figures, and 3D printing.
